Application Name: Hateabase (pronounced like database, except with an h instead of a d)

Description: 
The Hateabase will be a tool for analyzing hate crimes in the United States, 
specifically as they occurred in 2014 (should we complete the project for 2014 alone, 
we may add additional data and analysis for years before and after 2014, but for the 
time being a single year’s worth of data seems sufficient). 


Data Description: 
The data in the Hateabase will be pulled from the FBI’s reports on hate crimes in the 
United States for 2014. The data includes information on the crime, the victim, 
the motivation, and the location.
